# RetroDECK 0.7.6b

This a minor refresh update with some good news for PPSSPP.

**Release Date: XX/02/2024**

## Updates

- All emulators with newer versions
- RetroArch the nightly cores.

## New Features: Controller and Hotkey improvements

### PPSSPP

- The press `Escape` to `Open Menu` bind have been removed.
- Many of the standard combos and radial buttons now work

The upstream bug of combo hotkeys in the flatpak PPSSPP is now fixed.
You no longer need to press `Escape` button bind / radial button to `Open Menu`.

Thanks to this fix, everything is now mapped as it should in uniformity with the other emulators where possible.
The following binds are available:

- Quit Emulator
- Open Menu
- Save State
- Load State
- Previous / Next State
- Fastforward
- Rewind
- Rapid Fire Toggle
- Speed Toggle
- Record Video
- Fullscreen Toggle
- Emulator Screenshot


### Dolphin
- Improved Wii Remote `A` button bind: It is now multi-bound to `Mouse: Left Click` in addition to the standard button.

This change will allow you to navigate a Wii  System Menu or Wii in-game Menu with just the `Right Touchpad` pad on the Steam Deck.

## Bugfixes & other changes

- Added more Easter Egg Boot logos for some holidays
