## All 0.8b Emulators are running

Since last month all emulators we targeted are now running from within RetroDECK.

- Ryujinx
- OpenBOR
- Solarus
- IkemanGO (M.U.G.E.N)
- MAME

What is left is to make them compatible (where possible) with some of our tools and also update the configurations and inputs. But we are closing in on the finishing line!

## Will there be a Emulator Refresh soon?

Yes, we are working on 0.7.7b that will update the Emulators.

## ES-DE 3.0 in 0.8b

The ES-DE Team just released a major update version 3.0 of ES-DE with a lot of cool new features and that came with big architectural changes.

RetroDECK will need to accommodate for those changes so we can't ship a minor update with just ES-DE 3.0 but we will make it part of 0.8b as we need to verify everything and make the upgrade as safe and as smooth as possible.

### ES-DE Android Port

As we are friends with the ES-DE Team we also want to highlight that they just released their Android version of the app on the Amazon Appstore. This brings your favorite launcher to Android!

They have a one time donation purchase to buy the app and have removed their Patreon. So if you want to show the interface we all use some love, buy the app :)

We have gotten several more translations in the works to the Configurator Godot Version thanks to the RetroDECK community!

- English
- Swedish
- Japanese
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Italian
- German
- Ukrainian

Note that the Godot Configurator is not part of 0.8b but a later update.

## Update: External Controller Profiles

These are mostly done and ready for release in 0.8b and they have a little radial menu as well.

Check the following pages on how to try them today.

### Joystick as Mouse
This is a feature many underestimate the value of.

**What does this allow me to do?:**

This will allow you to do the following from your sofa for maximum laziness with a external controller:

- Play Point & Click Adventure games.
- Use Mouse in PC-System games.
- Play Lightgun games.
- Navigate PC Interfaces that can not be navigated by controllers like the Emulators GUI and change settings.
- Control the Wii Pointer and navigate Wii Menus with a normal controller (we are changing the Dolphin binds to account for this), press select and quickly capture those starbits with the right joystick.

**Standard Controllers:**

By holding `Select` + Moving the `Right Joystick` you can now simulate a mouse on a standard controller.

While holding `Select` use  `R3` to  `Left Click`.

While holding `Select` use `L3` and press the the `RetroDECK Logo` in the Radial Menu to `Right Click`.


**PS4 & PS5:**
All these features are enabled on the fly by using the built in touchpad and there is no need to use the `Right Joystick` (but you still can if you want to).

**Steam Controller:**
For the Steam Controller the `R4` button will toggle the `Right Touchpad` between permanent `Joystick Mode` or permanent `Mouse Mode`. But you can still do the hold `Select` + `Right Touchpad`  as `Mouse Mode` if you want to.


*"We in the RetroDECK Team have a strong commitment to make sure that our users don't need to move out of the sofa unless absolutely necessary"* ðŸ™ƒ


## That is all for February
