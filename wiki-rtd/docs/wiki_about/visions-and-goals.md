# Inspiration for RetroDECK and goals
RetroDECK is inspired by embedded emulation systems like:

- AmberELEC
- EmuELEC
- CoreELEC
- Lakka
- Batocera


The RetroDECK team consists of several veterans from some of the projects mentioned above as well as a bunch of other talented other individuals.


# What are the long term vision and goals of the RetroDECK project?


The long term vision and goals of the project is an all-in-one application to manage your entire retro games library that is:

- Already configured and should just work with your games.

- Has disaster recovery and multi device support: with cloud saves and syncs.

- Easy to install with one click installation.

- Easy to use and provide a "Console-like / Batocera-like" featured user experience.

- Easy to manage your collections of roms, mods and romhacks.

- As much as possible should be configurable from inside RetroDECK itself without needing to exiting the application.

- Make tighter integrations with bundled emulators and expose more features and ways to handle them to the end users.

- Should be secure, safe, and stable.

- Should have an easy way to mange external controllers and other inputs.

- Should support a majority of all supported Emulators in ES-DE, so at least you have one good option per system.

- Should in the long run support applications outside of the scope of ES-DE via a ports manager.

- Should be plug and play and fill the need for a portable retro gaming solution that you can bring on the go to a friendâ€™s/family/others house. Just dock into the TV and get going!

- Should fully support Steam Deck, Linux Desktop, other SteamOS or Linux based devices.

- AND MORE
