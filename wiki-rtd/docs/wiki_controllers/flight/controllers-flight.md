# Flight Controllers

Flight Controllers is a broad category that encompasses the vast majority of third party controllers that are used for playing games where you are flying airplanes or other things as magic carpets. <br>

Some of them might lack Linux drivers or udev rules entirely with others there is a community effort to make them work under Linux.<br>
A few of them also require Windows only software to configure various inputs and buttons.<br>

If you own a Flight Controller the best solution is just to try it on Linux via the Steam Deck Dock or a Linux PC and see if it works as expected.<br>
If it does work on Linux and it supports xinput, we see no reason why it should not work on RetroDECK.

If you have a Flight Controller that did not work on Linux but have found a way to make it work:<br>

- Please try to contribute udev rules to the [game-devices-udev codeberg](https://codeberg.org/fabiscafe/game-devices-udev)
- (Optional) Inform the RetroDECK team on how you got it working on discord.

**Always check for Linux Support**<br>
Just to be safe, it is better before you buy anything to double check if there is Linux support for it.
