[The xone Project](https://github.com/medusalix/xone) <br>
Has firmwares, udev rules and drivers might be needed to get it to run on your distribution to get the wireless connections working.

## How to configure?
As the XAC should be interpreted we `Xbox Wireless Controller` the RetroDECK team don't see any reason why this should not work with RetroDECK right out of the box.

None on the RetroDECK Team owns a XAC, but we would love to hear from your experiences using it with RetroDECK. <br>

If there is something we in the team can help you with, maybe we can design a better general Steam Input profile for the XAC or any other feedback feel free to contact us on Discord.
