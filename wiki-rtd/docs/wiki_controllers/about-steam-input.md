# Steam Input

RetroDECK handles most of the advanced controller mapping via Steam Input.

## All controls in Steam Input and RetroDECK can be changed
Everyone is free to rebind the buttons as you see fit in the any of the RetroDECK's Steam Input profiles, inside the emulators or both.
You can make your own profile to better suite your needs and combine it with input changes you make in each emulator.

But always remember if you rebind the keys inside RetroDECK in both Steam Input and the Emulators there will always be a risk that an upcoming update of either Steam or RetroDECK (thus including new versions of the built in Emulators) can come with changes that breaks your profiles.

Also note that if you break your controller profile with your tinkering you can always revert to the Official Controller Profiles or reinstall them from the Configurator.

## Prerequisites for Steam Input work

### RetroDECK must be added to Steam
In Steam go to the tab `Games` press `Add non Steam game to My library` and select RetroDECK to add it into your library or add it via the software `BoilR`.

### Device templates like Steam Deck
Devices like the Steam Deck with a built-in controller you will be able to find the profile under `Controller Settings` -> `Controller Layouts` -> `Templates`.

### Connect the external controller to find the templates for them
If you plan on using external controllers, you need to have the controller connected via either: `Cable` `Bluetooth` `Wireless`  for the controller profile to show up automatically. You will find the profile under `Controller Settings` -> `Controller Layouts` -> `Templates`.

### The following only applies to Linux Desktop:
