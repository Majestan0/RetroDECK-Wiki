A list of projects and drivers that try to make the Wii U controller work on Linux.

[libdrc](https://github.com/rolandoislas/libdrc)

There has been efforts of adding by the libdrc team of add their `hid-wiiu-drc` to the Linux Kernel. <br>

[linux-wiiu](https://gitlab.com/linux-wiiu/linux-wiiu)

Is a Linux distro that can be used on the Wii U machine. This seams to have a working `hid-wiiu-drc`
But the efforts to add it to the kernel seams to have been stalled.

## GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U

#### Steam Input support
Yes, but the connected controllers shows up as Generic Controllers

#### Linux Kernel Support
Yes, acts a normal USB-hub.

### How to connect?

In most cases you just need to connect it via USB and put the device in PC mode on the switch.

Sometimes the udev rule is missing and you will need to add it:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Type  `sudo echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="057e", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0337", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/51-gcadapter.rules > /dev/null`
3. Type  `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
4. Sometimes you will need to take out and reinsert the USB connector after you have reloaded the rules.
