## Yuzu Removal in the Next Update 0.8.0b

Hello everyone!

First this is not the real development blog post but a tiny extra one to adress one key issue:

As you might have heard Yuzu is no more and anyone supplying Yuzu is breaking the court settlement and could be targeted for litigation.

So as an effect of this, the RetroDECK Team will remove Yuzu from RetroDECK at the start of the next update 0.8.0b.
Please do an in-game save for all the games you want to transfer the save files from.


### Ryujinx will be included  in 0.8.0b

Ryujinx will be included as the default for Switch emulation as of 0.8.0b.

There will probably be a lot of migration guides written all over the internet in a short from all over.
All reference to Yuzu will be purged from the wiki and other places within our control

Thanks for your understanding!
