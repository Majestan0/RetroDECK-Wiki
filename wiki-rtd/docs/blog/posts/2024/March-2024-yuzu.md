## Yuzu & Citra Removal in the Next Update 0.8.0b

Hello everyone!

First this is not the real development blog post but a tiny extra one to adress one key issue:

As you might have heard Yuzu & Citra is no more and anyone supplying Yuzu or Citra is breaking the court settlement and could be targeted for litigation.

So as an effect of this, the RetroDECK Team will remove Yuzu & Citra from RetroDECK at the start of the next update 0.8.0b.

## Ryujinx will be included  in 0.8.0b

Ryujinx will be included as the default for Switch emulation as of 0.8.0b.
Please do an in-game save for all the games you want to transfer the save files from Yuzu.

There will probably be a lot of migration guides written all over the internet in a short from all over.
All reference to Yuzu will be purged from the wiki and other places within our control

## For 3DS Emulation

We are looking into alternatives like:

Thanks for your understanding!
