# IkemenGO / M.U.G.E.N - General Guide

<img src="../../../wiki_images/logos/ikemen-go-logo.png" width="150">

`IkemenGO` is a fighting game engine and the spiritual successor to the dead projects `Ikemen` and `M.U.G.E.N`. It strives to be compatible with games made for those engines.

## Where to put the games
`IkemenGO` `Ikemen` and `M.U.G.E.N` games should be put under the `retrodeck/roms/mugen/` directory.

## What file formats are supported?

`.mugen`

## Does IkemenGO require BIOS or Firmware?
No

## All M.U.G.E.N and IkemanGO games have their own input bindings

As every game it's own unique instance and input bindings they need to be manually rebound per game so they fit how the game works and how you want to play.
These bindings are usually set in the interface or in the file `<gamename>/save/config.json`.


## Information

- The games need to be uncompressed to a folder.
- Games made for `IkemenGO` have a higher success rate than those made for `M.U.G.E.N`.
- Each game is its own self-contained game, and no overarching settings exist.
- Depending on the age of the game you want to play it could require less or more tinkering.
- `M.U.G.E.N` have existed since the 90s and some incredibly old games might not run at all without heavy tinkering.
- You will need to make the game executable.

### Example folder structure of a IkemanGO game

```
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/chars/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/data/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/external/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/font/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/sound/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/stages/
~/retrodeck/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen
```
Notice the runnable Ultimate Dank Fighter Mugen.mugen

## IkemanGO Games

This How-to is for games that are made with IkemanGO

- Extract the game if it is compressed into a new folder under `roms/mugen/`.
- Rename the folder so it is called `<gamename>.mugen` in the end of it.
- Open the game folder and see if the `Ikemen_GO_Linux` file is there in the root of the folder.
- If the file is there rename it to `<gamename>.mugen`.
- Make the game executable.
- Note that BOTH the `Ikemen_GO_Linux` file and the game folder are now called the same `<gamename>.mugen`.

The game should now be detected and runnable from RetroDECK.

### Example on renaming:
If the game is called Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO rename the `Ikemen_GO_Linux` file & the games folder to `Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen`

```
/roms/mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen/Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen
```

The `Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen` file exists within the `Ultimate Dank Fighter IkemanGO.mugen` folder.

### Ikemen_GO_Linux is missing:

If the `Ikemen_GO_Linux` is missing in the games folder you can download it from the [IkemanGO Github](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO) under releases called
`Ikemen_GO-<latestversion>-linux.zip`.

Open up the `.zip` file and extract ONLY the `Ikemen_GO_Linux` file into the game directory and rename it as stated above.
