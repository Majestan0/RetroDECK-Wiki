## Where to put the games
Solarus games should be put under the `retrodeck/roms/solarus/` directory.

## What file format is supported?

`.solarus`

- Solarus games are all contained in the Solarus file `.solarus`


## Solarus TIPS
- There is no overarching setting over all Solarus games as each game is full separate game.
- Some games don't autostart in Fullscreen so you need to either `Select + West (X, Square)` or press ` CTRL + Enter`  or ` Alt + Enter`
- To quit games you need to press `Escape` that exists on in the radial menu system for the controllers.
