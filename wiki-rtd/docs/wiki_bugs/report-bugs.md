# Reporting bugs and issues.

Report all issues to the RetroDECK via the functions below including emulator related issues as we are putting our own framework on top of the emulators. So what looks like a emulator issue could sometimes be a framework issue.

Do not report any emulator related issues to the emulator developers directly and their support channels.

If it is a emulator bug and the RetroDECK Team believes it to be from the upstream emulator.
The RetroDECK Team will then report and discuss it directly with the emulator developers.

## Before you report:
- Check [Github issues](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues/) on reported issues.
- Check the [Known Issues](../wiki_bugs/known-issues.md).


## How to Report?

You can submit bugs and issues on:

- On [Github issues](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues/)
- On [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dz3szYsP8g) in the `ü§ù-community-support` or `üÜò-support` channels.
    - If you are not certain of a issue it is better to discuss it with the community in <br>
     `ü§ù-community-support` before submitting it.
