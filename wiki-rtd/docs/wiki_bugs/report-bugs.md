# Reporting bugs and issues.

Report all issues to the RetroDECK via the functions below including emulator related issues as we are putting our own framework on top of the emulators. So what looks like a emulator issue could sometimes be a framework issue.

Do not report any emulator related issues to the emulator developers directly and their support channels.

If it is a emulator bug and the RetroDECK Team believes it to be from the upstream emulator.
The RetroDECK Team will then report and discuss it directly with the emulator developers.

## Before you report:
- Check [Github issues](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues/) on reported issues.
- Check the [Known Issues](../wiki_bugs/known-issues.md).


## How to Report?

RetroDECK's main issue tracker is on GitHub but we try to keep it clean of just real issues and not general guidance or help, that is what the Wiki and Discord is for.

The general rule of thumb is:

- If it is something you want to discuss, don't understand, want to ask a question or just need general guidance start with `ü§ù-community-support` channel on Discord. Things submitted here will be answered by the community or sometimes the RetroDECK Team.
- If you think it is something bigger or semi-certain what the issue is but maybe lack the technical know-how and want to have a deeper discussion do it the `üÜò-support` channel on Discord. Things submitted here are mostly discussed with the RetroDECK Team but certain community members might join.
- If you know what the issue is to to great detail and maybe even have found a solution for it submit directly on Github.

### Discord

[Discord](https://discord.gg/Dz3szYsP8g)

Discord is used for more guidance type issues and community support. Things discussed there that are of importance for all users will later be added to the wiki or a github issue.

### GitHub

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues/)

GitHub is RetroDECK's main issue tracker where development and known issues are submitted.
