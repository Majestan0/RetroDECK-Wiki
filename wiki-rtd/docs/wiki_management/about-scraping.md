# Scraping

ES-DE supports the two scraper services [ScreenScraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) and [TheGamesDB.net](https://thegamesdb.net/).

Scraping allows you to make the games look "pretty" with coverarts, icons, discimages and more.

###Quick tips
- On most occasions you want to use ScreenScraper and not TheGamesDB. But for PC titles scraping from TheGamesDB might be better.
- You will need to register an account on [ScreenScraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) to scrape (support them on Patreon for faster downloads, more scrapes per day and priority scraping).
- Login to your Screenscraper.fr account inside of the ES-DE interface in RetroDECK
- Choose what content you want to scrape (remember that each content you choose could take up several mb of data per game).
- Do an initial scrape of all the games you want to scrape.
- If some games are missed do a more narrow scraping by enabling `Scraper -> Other Settings -> Interactive Mode -> On`& Scraper -> `Other Settings -> Auto-Accept Single Game Matches -> On` and choose to scrape by games missing metadata. This will allow you to select each game from a list and also tweak the searches of the missing games.
- In some cases you need to remove certain aspects of the name like if a rom comes both with a Japanese name and English name, you could try to remove one of the names to find a better result.
