# RetroDECK CLI Commmands

## How do I run RetroDECK CLI commands?

Open a Linux terminal on your desktop (on the Steam Deck you need to be in desktop mode). Depending on what terminal application you have installed the naming of the application can be different.<br>

In Linux distributions that uses KDE desktop environment as well as the Steam Deck; the default application is called _Konsole_.
<br>
The default command to run retrodeck options and arguments is:

```
flatpak run [FLATPAK-RUN-OPTION] net.retrodeck.retrodeck [ARGUMENTS]
```

Where `[FLATPAK-RUN-OPTION]` is replaced by a flatpak run option (if there is one) and `[ARGUMENTS]` is replaced by arguments.

**Example:**

This syntax runs the `--reset-all` argument that resets the application to default settings.

```
flatpak run net.retrodeck-retrodeck --reset-all
```

Where the argument `--reset-all` replaced `[ARGUMENTS]` and `[FLATPAK-RUN-OPTION]`was not needed to it was removed.
