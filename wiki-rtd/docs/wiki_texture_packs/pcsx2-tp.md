# Texture Packs: PCSX2 - Playstation 2
The `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/` represents the `/PCSX2/textures/` folder in PCSX2.

**Note:** <br>
Some texture packs could made for a specific version or region of a game. Make sure you have the right game and textures for it.

**Note:**<br>
`TITLEID` is different for every game.

## Enable Custom Textures

* Press `Settings` -> `Graphics` <br>

`Load Textures` and set it to `On`.<br>

## How do I add texture packs?

**Requirements:** Texture pack files <br>

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this could be easier to do in `Desktop Mode`.


### Texture folder directly

1. Extract any texture pack files from compressed `.zip` or any other format into folders.
2. Go into `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/`. The folders are all named by `TITLEID`.
3. Move textures into the right `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/<TITLEID>` folder.
