# What devices/systems does RetroDECK currently support?

RetroDECK currently supports two systems:

- Steam Deck
- Linux Desktop

## Steam Deck LCD/OLED

Supported from the beginning. RetroDECK is tailored to the Steam Deck.

### Other SteamOS devices

SteamOS the operative system will always be supported but as of today there are no other officialy released devices with SteamOS other the Valve's Steam Deck lineup.

## Linux Desktop

It is working, but the user experience might not be that great it as we want it to be just yet.
You will also need to manually configure the input to match your desktop and might need to tweak more settings. If you want to try it make sure that your distribution has flatpak support (else you will need to install it).

## Q&A Supported Systems

### Will you support Windows or Windows based devices like the ROG Ally?

No, RetroDECK doesn't support Windows currently and there are no plans to do so.
As an alternative you could try [RetroBat](https://www.retrobat.org/) that offers similar functionality in a Windows environment.
How ever if you install a Linux distribution on your device instead you can try out RetroDECK.

### Will you support ARM devices like iOS or MacOS?
ARM devices are not supported currently. ES-DE does support the ARM emulators but it is a very different landscape.
It would be a major undertaking but maybe one day in the far off future it could be possible. But it would need to be a different experience as the emulators, other underlying systems would not be the same and would need to be rewritten.

### Will you support Android?
No, we believe that is not really possible to bundle and preconfigure emulators on Android unfortunately as of now.

### Will you support other distribution methods usch as Snap or AppImage?
It's not in our roadmap yet as now the entire buildsystem is based on the flatpak-build that builds the software via the flatpak manifest.
In the past we evaluated to migrate to **Buildstream** (or similar solutions) and build on to multiple output formats.

But the team is not large enough to migrate and maintain other distribution methods, so we prefer to focus our effort on Flatpak only.
If someone with the knowledge and passion wishes to help us with migrating to a solution and help us maintain it, we are open for a discussion.
