## Missing Features
We plan to add more emulators, systems and functions over course of the development cycle. <br>
The goal is to support almost all of the systems ES-DE supports and ship the best emulator or program for that system.

We don't have any plans to ship all emulators or programs in existence for each system but virtually only the **"best once"** per-system.
In some cases we might ship more then one Emulator if the feature set is vastly diffrent or the user demand is high.

For the latest things The RetroDECK Team is working on check: <br>
`Development üñ•Ô∏è` - `What are you working on?` and `Version History (Patchnotes)`
